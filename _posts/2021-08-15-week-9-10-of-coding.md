Hello everyone,

This blog contains my progress for week 9 and 10. During these two weeks I have been refactoring my PRs and creating documentation for them.

&nbsp;

### Week 9 (2 Aug - 8 Aug)

During the week, I refactored my PR [#1600](https://github.com/weecology/retriever/pull/1600) according to the reviews by my mentor.
I also worked upon the `RDatasets` prototype and wrote test functions for it.

&nbsp;

### Week 10 (9 Aug - 15 Aug)

During this week, I refactored my PR [#1606](https://github.com/weecology/retriever/pull/1606) on adding the dataset `tidycensus`.
And prepared for the documentations of my PRs.

Since this is the last week of coding, and my final evaluations will start from 16th August 2021, this would be my last blog.
I would be writing a blog regarding my final evaluations after the results are declared.

See you guys next week!!
